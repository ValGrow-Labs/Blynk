  // worse, it is NOT what the customer app draws. The customer renders a FLAT
  // ink scrim at BlynkPromo.scrimOpacity (0.66) across the whole image.
  //
  // A preview whose treatment differs from the real screen is worse than an
  // ugly one: the operator tunes their artwork against a render that does not
  // exist. Matching the flat 0.66 both lightens the left and makes the preview
  // truthful. Keep this number in step with BlynkPromo.scrimOpacity in
  // apps/customer/.../lib/design/components.dart.
  // 2026-09-24 (migration 009): the card crops its background with `cover`,
  // and that crop used to be anchored at `center` - so a banner whose wording
  // runs along the top lost the wording. The stored focal point moves the
  // anchor, and the preview has to use it or it stops being truthful: the
  // customer app anchors its own `BoxFit.cover` at exactly this point.
