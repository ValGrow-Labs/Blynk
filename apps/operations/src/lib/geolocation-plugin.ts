/**
 * FOREGROUND-ONLY browser Geolocation adapter for Operations' Delivery Mode
 * (common.md rule 10; task-F4-brief.md's "Live location" section - read
 * both before touching this file).
 *
 * This is the ONLY file in the Operations app allowed to read
 * `navigator.geolocation` directly, mirroring the role
 * apps/rider/src/lib/tracking-plugin.ts plays for the Rider app's own
 * plugin - but this is deliberately NOT that file's Capacitor adapter, and
 * NOT a port of it. It is a plain, standard `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition`/
 * `clearWatch` wrapper:
 *
 *   - NO Capacitor, NO `@capacitor-community/background-geolocation`, NO
 *     native background-location plugin of any kind - explicitly out of
 *     scope for this pass (common.md rule 10). That is a large, separate
 *     undertaking on the scale of the Rider app's own live-location phase.
 *   - It tracks ONLY while the browser tab that opened the Delivery Detail
 *     screen is open and (per most browsers' own power-saving behaviour)
 *     foregrounded - unlike the Rider app's native watcher, this has no
 *     ability to keep reporting a position once the tab is backgrounded,
 *     closed, or the device is locked. This is a genuinely lesser
 *     capability than the Rider app's, not an equivalent one - documented
 *     here, in task-F4-report.md, and in the Delivery Detail screen's own
 *     UI copy, so no operator or reviewer mistakes it for the same thing.
 *   - `lib/tracking.ts`'s `DeliveryTracker` class (ported unchanged, since
 *     it already depends only on the small `TrackingPlugin` interface below,
 *     never on Capacitor) is what actually owns the throttle/permission
 *     state machine; this file is only the thin adapter underneath it, so a
 *     future native wrapper (if ever built) would only need to replace this
 *     one file, exactly like Rider's own `capacitorTrackingPlugin` note
 *     says of itself.
 *
 * Every function reads `navigator.geolocation` fresh on each call rather
 * than caching a reference at module load, so a test can inject a fake
 * implementation before the plugin is ever exercised (task-F4-brief.md's
 * "write this against injectable/mockable geolocation, not real browser
 * APIs").
