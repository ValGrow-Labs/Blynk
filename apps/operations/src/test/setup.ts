 * Every test stubs `fetch` per test via `vi.stubGlobal`/`vi.unstubAllGlobals()`

 * `fetch` was before the FIRST stub in a file - in this Node-based jsdom
 * environment that is Node's own built-in `fetch`, which can reach a real
 * server if one happens to be running on localhost (common.md: "a backend
 * dev server may or may not be running... never assume one is available").
 * A component with several parallel in-flight requests that haven't all
 * settled by the time a test's own assertions resolve (e.g. Home's summary
 * fetch, F2) can leak an unmocked request into the brief gap between one
 * test's cleanup and the next test's stub - if a real dev server is running,
 * that stray request gets a genuine response (observed: a real 401 for the
 * fake test bearer token), which cascades into a spurious session-end
 * unrelated to whatever the next test was actually checking. Overwriting the
 * *pre-stub* `fetch` here, once per test file before any test/stub runs,
 * means `unstubAllGlobals()` always restores to this safe no-op instead -
 * nothing a test does can ever reach a real network.
