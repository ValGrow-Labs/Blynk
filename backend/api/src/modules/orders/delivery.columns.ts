/**
 * Which `deliveries` columns an API response may carry.
 *
 * The rider's live position (migration 006) reaches exactly one consumer: the
 * order's own customer, through the SSE stream (`findTrackableLocationForCustomer`)
 * - plan §D.6 has no admin, staff or rider location surface in this phase. The
 * rider's write (`RiderRepository.writeLocation`) names the location columns
 * itself.
 *
 * Every other query that returns a delivery row selects DELIVERY_PUBLIC_COLUMNS
 * (an allow-list, never `selectAll`), and anything that receives a whole row
 * from the lifecycle engine passes it through `toPublicDelivery`. A column added
 * to `deliveries` is therefore private until someone adds it here, and
 * tests/delivery-payload-privacy.test.ts fails until every column is classified.
